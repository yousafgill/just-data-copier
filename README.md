- **Intelligent Compression**: Automatic file type detection with optimized compression levels
- **Resume Capability**: Chunk-level precision resume with integrity verification
- **Network Adaptation**: Real-time profiling with automatic performance tuning
- **Enterprise Security**: Path validation, input sanitization, and structured error handling
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-based logging with session tracking and privacy focus
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean interfaces with dependency injection and comprehensive testing

## üìã Requirements & Architecture

### System Requirements
- Go 1.21+ for building from source
- Network connectivity between client and server
- Adequate disk space for file transfers

### Architecture Overview
- **Modular Design**: Clean package structure with dependency injection
- **Binary Protocol**: Efficient communication with hash algorithm negotiation
- **Enterprise Quality**: Structured error types, security best practices, and operational excellence
- **Scalability**: Optimized for files from MB to TB+ with optimized memory usage

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Server Mode (Receiver)
```bash
jdc -server -output ./destination_folder
jdc -server -listen 192.168.1.10:9000 -output ./destination_folder
```

### Client Mode (Sender)
```bash
jdc -file ./my_large_file.dat -connect server_address:8000
jdc -file ./large_log_file.txt -connect server_address:8000 -compress
```

### Common Options
- `-compress`: Enable compression (optimized by file type)
- `-chunk <bytes>`: Chunk size (default: 2MB)
- `-buffer <bytes>`: Buffer size (default: 512KB)
- `-workers <num>`: Concurrent workers (default: half CPU cores)
- `-adaptive`: Enable adaptive network optimization
- `-timeout <duration>`: Operation timeout (default: 2m)

## üîê Security & Performance

### Security Features
- **Path Validation**: Directory traversal protection and input sanitization
- **Privacy Logging**: No sensitive file paths or hash values in logs
- **Structured Errors**: Categorized error types without sensitive details
- **Resource Management**: Bounded usage and proper cleanup

### Performance Optimization

#### Hash Algorithm Intelligence
| File Size | Algorithm | Performance Benefit |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| < 50GB | MD5 | Fastest for smaller files |
| ‚â• 50GB | BLAKE2b | 35% faster than SHA-256, secure |

#### Network Tuning Examples
```bash
# High-speed LAN (1Gbps+)
jdc -file ./file.dat -connect server:8000 -chunk 8388608 -workers 8

# Internet (100Mbps+)  
jdc -file ./file.dat -connect server:8000 -chunk 4194304 -workers 4 -adaptive

# High-latency Network
jdc -file ./file.dat -connect server:8000 -chunk 1048576 -adaptive
```

## üîß Advanced Capabilities
