- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error categorization and handling
- **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration with validation
- **Security**: Path validation and directory traversal protection
- **Monitoring**: Progress reporting and transfer statistics
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Signal handling for clean application termination

### Performance Optimizations
- **Network Profiling**: Automatic network condition detection
- **Adaptive Chunking**: Dynamic chunk size adjustment based on network performance
- **Buffer Management**: Configurable buffer sizes for optimal throughput
- **TCP Optimization**: Socket-level optimizations for better performance

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Network connectivity between client and server
- Adequate disk space for file transfers

## Usage

JDC operates in two modes: server (receiver) and client (sender). The executable name is `jdc` (or `jdc.exe` on Windows).

### Server Mode

Start the server to receive files:

```bash
jdc -server -output ./destination_folder
```

By default, the server listens on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) port 8000. You can specify a different listening address:

```bash
jdc -server -listen 192.168.1.10:9000 -output ./destination_folder
```

### Client Mode

Send a file to a server:

```bash
jdc -file ./my_large_file.dat -connect server_address:8000
```

For improved performance with text files, enable compression:

```bash
jdc -file ./large_log_file.txt -connect server_address:8000 -compress
```

### Common Options

- `-compress`: Enable on-the-fly compression (optimized by file type)
- `-chunk <bytes>`: Set chunk size in bytes (default: 2MB)
- `-buffer <bytes>`: Set buffer size in bytes (default: 512KB)
- `-workers <num>`: Set number of concurrent workers (default: half of CPU cores)
- `-verify <bool>`: Enable/disable file integrity verification (default: enabled)
- `-adaptive`: Use adaptive delay based on network conditions (default: disabled)
- `-progress <bool>`: Show/hide progress during transfer (default: enabled)
- `-timeout <duration>`: Set operation timeout (default: 2m)
- `-retries <num>`: Set number of retries for failed operations (default: 5)

## Performance Tuning

For optimal performance, you can adjust these parameters based on your specific network environment:

- **Chunk Size**: Larger chunks (e.g., `-chunk 4194304` for 4MB) can improve performance on reliable networks with low latency
- **Buffer Size**: Adjust buffer size with `-buffer` for different network conditions:
  - Larger buffers (e.g., `-buffer 1048576` for 1MB) can help on high-bandwidth networks
  - Smaller buffers may work better on congested networks
- **Workers**: More workers (e.g., `-workers 8`) can improve throughput on high-bandwidth connections
- **Delay Settings**: Fine-tune adaptive delay with `-min-delay` and `-max-delay` parameters
- **Compression**: Enable compression (`-compress`) for text files, logs, and other compressible data

### Examples for Different Network Types:

#### High-speed LAN (1Gbps+):
```bash
jdc -file ./large_file.dat -connect server:8000 -chunk 8388608 -buffer 1048576 -workers 8
```

#### Internet Connection (100Mbps+):
```bash
jdc -file ./large_file.dat -connect server:8000 -chunk 4194304 -buffer 524288 -workers 4 -adaptive
```

#### Unstable or High-latency Network:
```bash
jdc -file ./large_file.dat -connect server:8000 -chunk 1048576 -buffer 262144 -adaptive -min-delay 10ms -max-delay 200ms
```

## Advanced Features

### Automatic Network Profiling

JDC automatically profiles the network at the beginning of a transfer to optimize:
- Round-trip time (RTT) measurement
- Optimal chunk size calculation
- Bandwidth estimation
- Worker thread allocation

### Intelligent Compression

The compression feature intelligently:
- Compresses text files and other highly compressible formats using gzip
- Skips compression for already compressed formats (images, videos, archives)
- Adapts compression levels based on file type (better compression for text files, faster compression for binary)
- Shows compression ratios during transfer

### Adaptive Networking

When enabled with `-adaptive`, monitors network performance and adjusts chunk delays for optimal throughput:
- Automatically reduces send rate when network congestion is detected
- Increases send rate when network conditions improve
- Configurable with `-min-delay` and `-max-delay`
- Provides real-time feedback about network conditions
- Disabled by default for more predictable behavior

### Transfer Resume Capability

If a transfer is interrupted:
- The partial state is saved in a `.justdatacopier.state` file
- When restarting the transfer with the same parameters, only missing chunks are transferred
- State files are automatically cleaned up after successful transfers

## Technical Details

### Architecture

Just Data Copier uses a client-server architecture:

1. **Server Mode**: 
   - Listens for incoming connections
   - Manages output directory and file creation
   - Handles chunk requests and reassembly
   - Verifies file integrity upon completion

2. **Client Mode**:
   - Establishes connection to the server
   - Profiles network conditions
   - Sends file metadata (name, size)
   - Manages chunking and sending of file data
   - Provides hash for verification

### Implementation Details

- **Chunking**: Files are split into configurable-sized chunks for parallel processing
- **TCP Optimizations**: Sets TCP_NODELAY, larger buffers, and keep-alive for optimized transmission
- **Context-based Cancellation**: Uses Go contexts for proper timeout handling and cancellation
- **Buffered I/O**: Employs bufio for efficient reading and writing
- **Error Handling**: Implements retry mechanisms for transient failures
- **Logging**: Provides detailed logs for monitoring and troubleshooting

### Logging

Log files are stored in the `logs/` directory with timestamps:
```
logs/justdatacopier_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
```
