## Usage

JDC operates in two modes: server (receiver) and client (sender). The executable name is `jdc` (or `jdc.exe` on Windows).

### Server Mode

Start the server to receive files:

```bash
jdc -server -output ./destination_folder
```

By default, the server listens on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) port 8000. You can specify a different listening address:

```bash
jdc -server -listen 192.168.1.10:9000 -output ./destination_folder
```

### Client Mode

Send a file to a server:

```bash
jdc -file ./my_large_file.dat -connect server_address:8000
```

For improved performance with text files, enable compression:

```bash
jdc -file ./large_log_file.txt -connect server_address:8000 -compress
```

### Common Options

- `-compress`: Enable on-the-fly compression (optimized by file type)
- `-chunk <bytes>`: Set chunk size in bytes (default: 2MB)
- `-buffer <bytes>`: Set buffer size in bytes (default: 512KB)
- `-workers <num>`: Set number of concurrent workers (default: half of CPU cores)
- `-verify <bool>`: Enable/disable file integrity verification (default: enabled)
- `-adaptive`: Use adaptive delay based on network conditions (default: disabled)
- `-progress <bool>`: Show/hide progress during transfer (default: enabled)
- `-timeout <duration>`: Set operation timeout (default: 2m)
- `-retries <num>`: Set number of retries for failed operations (default: 5)

## üîê Security & Reliability

## ‚ö° Performance Tuning

### Hash Algorithm Optimization
JustDataCopier automatically selects the optimal hash algorithm based on file size:

| File Size | Algorithm | Performance Benefit |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| < 50GB | MD5 | Fastest for smaller files |
| ‚â• 50GB | BLAKE2b | 35% faster than SHA-256, cryptographically secure |

For a 2TB file, BLAKE2b reduces hash calculation time from ~60 minutes (SHA-256) to ~35 minutes while maintaining cryptographic security.

### Network Optimization
For optimal performance, adjust these parameters based on your network environment:

- **Chunk Size**: Larger chunks (e.g., `-chunk 4194304` for 4MB) can improve performance on reliable networks with low latency
- **Buffer Size**: Adjust buffer size with `-buffer` for different network conditions:
  - Larger buffers (e.g., `-buffer 1048576` for 1MB) can help on high-bandwidth networks
  - Smaller buffers may work better on congested networks
- **Workers**: More workers (e.g., `-workers 8`) can improve throughput on high-bandwidth connections
- **Delay Settings**: Fine-tune adaptive delay with `-min-delay` and `-max-delay` parameters
- **Compression**: Enable compression (`-compress`) for text files, logs, and other compressible data

### Examples for Different Network Types:

#### High-speed LAN (1Gbps+):
```bash
jdc -file ./large_file.dat -connect server:8000 -chunk 8388608 -buffer 1048576 -workers 8
```

#### Internet Connection (100Mbps+):
```bash
jdc -file ./large_file.dat -connect server:8000 -chunk 4194304 -buffer 524288 -workers 4 -adaptive
```

#### Unstable or High-latency Network:
```bash
jdc -file ./large_file.dat -connect server:8000 -chunk 1048576 -buffer 262144 -adaptive -min-delay 10ms -max-delay 200ms
```
