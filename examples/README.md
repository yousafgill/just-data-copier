## üöÄ Quick Setup Guide

### Find Out Your Network Speed
```cmd
# Test your internet connection first
ping google.com
# For detailed speed test, use online tools like speedtest.net
```

### Best Settings for Different Connections

| Connection Type | Chunk Size | Buffer Size | Workers | Extra Options |
|----------------|------------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **Office LAN (Fast)** | 8MB | 1MB | 8 | `-verify=true` |
| **Good Internet** | 4MB | 512KB | 4 | `-adaptive` |
| **Slow Internet** | 1MB | 256KB | 2 | `-adaptive -retries 10` |
| **Unstable Connection** | 2MB | 512KB | 2 | `-adaptive -timeout 5m` |

## üìä How Fast Will It Be?

### File Transfer Speed Examples (Rough Estimates)
| File Size | Over Fast LAN | Over Good Internet | Over Slow Internet |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1GB | ~1-2 minutes | ~5-10 minutes | ~15-30 minutes |
| 10GB | ~10-20 minutes | ~45-90 minutes | ~2-5 hours |
| 100GB | ~2-3 hours | ~8-15 hours | ~1-2 days |
| 1TB | ~1-2 days | ~3-7 days | ~1-2 weeks |

*These are rough estimates - your actual speed depends on your specific network*

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Problems & Solutions

### Transfer Going Slow?
```cmd
# Try reducing the number of workers
jdc.exe -file large.dat -connect server:8000 -workers 2

# Or use adaptive mode
jdc.exe -file large.dat -connect server:8000 -adaptive
```

### Connection Keeps Dropping?
```cmd
# Increase timeout and retries
jdc.exe -file large.dat -connect server:8000 -timeout 10m -retries 15

# Use smaller chunks for bad connections
jdc.exe -file large.dat -connect server:8000 -chunk 524288 -adaptive
```

### Computer Running Out of Memory?
```cmd
# Use smaller buffers
jdc.exe -file large.dat -connect server:8000 -buffer 131072 -workers 2
```

## üìñ Things to Remember

### Before Starting Big Transfers
1. **Test First**: Always try a small file first to make sure everything works
2. **Check Space**: Make sure you have enough disk space on both computers
3. **Good Timing**: Start big transfers when the network isn't busy (like at night)
4. **Have Backups**: Always keep backups of important files before moving them

### Keep Your Data Safe
1. **Secure Networks**: Use VPN or secure networks for sensitive files
2. **Limit Access**: Only let authorized people connect to your transfer server
3. **Watch the Logs**: Keep an eye on transfer logs to spot problems
4. **Test Everything**: Try your setup with test files before using it for real work

### Make It Work Better
1. **Monitor Transfers**: Keep track of how transfers are going
2. **Script Repetitive Tasks**: Use batch files for transfers you do often
3. **Document Settings**: Write down what settings work best for your network
4. **Test Changes**: Always test new settings in a safe environment first
